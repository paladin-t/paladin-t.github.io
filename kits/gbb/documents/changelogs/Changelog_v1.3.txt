This release introduces support for importing and managing external ROMs,
providing greater flexibility for developers working with existing game assets.
There are two new sprite properties available `BANK_PROP` and `OBJPAL_PROP`
which enhanced coding flexibility for CGB sprites. Now emotes support
8x8px-per-tile based sprites. Fixed some known bugs, improved usability and
