This release introduces support for custom kernels, allowing users to replace
the default game runtime for their projects. The editor now supports installing
and selecting custom kernels. Added new syntax to support more flexible actor
control. It also includes many other improvements and bug fixes to the runtime,
compiler, and usability. A new "Scroll Shooting" kernel and a starter kit which
takes use of it were also added. Added new tutorials chapters and content. There
are also other updates to the examples and documents.
