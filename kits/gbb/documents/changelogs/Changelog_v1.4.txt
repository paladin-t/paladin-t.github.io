This release introduces support for SGB features. It also includes a number of
quality of life improvements, for instance, direct preview for map, scene, and
actor assets with one-click. The memory related statements have been updated to
support getting bank and address of assets, inline data sequence. Added new
tutorials chapters and content. There are also some other improvements and bug
fixes.
