This release introduces a public Tutorials platform, which provides a learning
environment that is easier to read and practice with than the built-in
documentation. Currently, about one-third of the content is complete, with
subsequent content to be updated gradually. You can find the entry point by
clicking the main menu, then clicking Help. Additionally, this update enhances
the syntax's adaptability and convenience for different coding styles and fixes
some bugs in the runtime, compiler and asset pipeline, and the editors. This
version also adds a new "Minimal" starter kit for quickly building your game
framework.
