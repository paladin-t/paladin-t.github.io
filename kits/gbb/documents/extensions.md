## Extensions

GB BASIC implements a few extension features upon the original architecture, which defines the "[fantasy](/kits/gbb/about.html#why-fantasy-console)" part of the console.

The introduction of these extended features stems from a thought of mine: what could we do if we were to reinterpret old handheld consoles from a modern perspective? For instance, the idea of adding touchscreen support led to the creation of the "touch" API family...

# Kernel Extension

To enable extension for the built-in emulator, click the main menu, then "Application", "Preferences...", switch to the "Device" tab, choose a device type with "extension". To enable extension for a project and its output ROM, open the project properties dialog, choose a cart type with "extension".

GB BASIC has implemented the kernel extension by taking use of a chunk of unused bus addresses of the original architecture. See the [Implementation Instructions](#implementation-instructions) section below for details.

## Platform Detection

GB BASIC is extended with a new set of [platform detection](/kits/gbb/manual.html#platform-detection) operations.

* This feature uses the `PLTF` register to store platform information.

## Mouse and Touch

GB BASIC is extended with a new set of [mouse and touch](/kits/gbb/manual.html#mouse-and-touch) API.

* This feature uses the `TCHX`, `TCHY` and `TCHF` registers to transfer mouse/touch data.
  * `TCHX`: the x position in pixels, with range of values from 0 to 159
  * `TCHY`: the y position in pixels, with range of values from 0 to 143
  * `TCHF`: the mouse/touch pressing status, `0x00` for no pressing, `0x01` for the first finger touched or LMB (Left Mouse Button), `0x02` for RMB (Right Mouse Button)

## Keyboard Input

GB BASIC is extended with a new set of [keyboard Input](/kits/gbb/manual.html#keyboard-input) API.

* This feature uses the `KEYM` and `KEYC` registers to transfer keyboard data.
  * `KEYM`: the key modifier flags, `0x00` for no pressing, `0x01` for Ctrl, `0x02` for Shift, `0x04` for Alt, `0x08` for Meta, and these bits can be combined
  * `KEYC`: the key code, with range of values from 0 to 255, `0x00` for no key pressed; after reading, also write `0x00` to it to acknowledge to accept more key codes

### Keyboard Protocol

Device fills the `KEYM` register with the key modifier flags continuously per frame.

Device reads key-up codes of keyboard, and stores it in a FIFO queue, the queue can store up to 2 key codes. The `KEYC` register is the head of the queue, and the device reads it continuously to get if the queue head is cleared to `0x00`, if so, it sets the `KEYC` register to the next key code in the queue, and make another available slot for new coming code. Device cannot append new code to the queue if the queue is full.

### Transfer Protocol

Device reads the `STMF` register continuously to wait until it's set to the "Filled" status; then it reads the `STMB` byte and clears it with 0; after that, it sets the `STMF` register to "Ready" status so that the VM can write to it again; finally it waits for a "End-ofstream" status, then sets the `STMF` register to "Ready" as well, and raises a file saving request to serialize the streamed binary data.

Device reads the `TRSF` register continuously to wait until it's set to the "Filled" status; then it reads all the bytes from the transfer buffer and clears it with 0; finally it sets the `TRSF` register to the "Ready" status so that the VM can write to it again.

Device takes further actions determined by the heading byte(s) of the read buffer data.
