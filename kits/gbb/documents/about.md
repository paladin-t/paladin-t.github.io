# About This Software

Hi, I'm Tony Wang.

Enlightened with BASIC, I started to write computer programs when I was a young boy. Almost at the same age, I got a GameBoy Pocket as my first handheld gaming console. I was quite into these both things. I learned many other programming languages and owned quite a number of newer consoles with age. Now I'm almost living by writing game programs, and could still have a lot of fun from these two of my hobbies.

I found that the simple and straightforward nature of BASIC and GameBoy became more charming when the other modern technologies went complex and excessive. I've worked on a lot of game, game development tool and programming language projects both in office and home. Eventually, I managed to bring you GB BASIC, I hope you would enjoy.

## Why Fantasy Console?

Most of the technical specifications are referenced from real hardwares, however GB BASIC also implements a few <a href="/kits/gbb/extensions.html#kernel-extension">extension</a> features which are fictional. On the other hand, these features are totally implementable, technically it is possible that we could see these features on hardware.
