## Project Structure

A GB BASIC project is saved as a ".gbb" file, which is in a text-based format and friendly to version control systems and external editors, with all assets encoded in printable UTF-8 characters or Base64 string, and uses Unix LF ('\n') for line ending. A project consists of at least one page of source code, and none or a few pages of other assets (tiles, maps, actors, music, etc). All these assets are organized and packed in sections one after another in a single file. A project will appear on the main screen once it has been created or imported to GB BASIC.

GB BASIC also supports importing plain source code, which consists of only one source code page without other assets.

## Compiler and VM

### Compiler Architecture

The following diagram gives a high-level overview of the compiler architecture and asset pipeline.

![](imgs/gbbvm_compiler.png)

* The compiler compiles source code into VM instructions, the asset pipeline processes assets into binary data
  * Banking is automatically determined for instructions and asset data
* The kernel (VM) loads and executes compiled instructions, loads and makes use of processed asset data
* The kernel runs on top of a real hardware, emulator or simulator

### VM Architecture

The VM layer of GB BASIC is based on the [GBVM](https://github.com/untoxa/gbvm) project. The following diagram gives a complete overview of the VM architecture.

![](imgs/gbbvm_architecture.png)

* Compiled instructions can be stored in different ROM banks if necessary
* The kernel supports up to 16 threads with concurrent contexts
  * Threads share the same physical memory
* Every thread has its own registers (not accessible from code) and stacks (accessible from code)
* All threads share a same area of RAM for globals (accessible from code)

The following diagram gives a detailed overview of the VM RAM layout.

![](imgs/gbbvm_ram_layout.png)

* Each thread context has its own stack for:
  * thread parameters (optional),
  * thread locals, stack entries,
  * evaluation intermediates,
  * function parameters, return points, etc.
* The basic growth and accessible unit from code is 16-bit

# Programming

## Program Structure

GB BASIC programs do not have a designated entry point; they begin execution from the first executable statement on the initial code page and proceed linearly. When the end of a code page is reached, the program concludes as if an `end` statement were present at the page's termination. Control can migrate between code pages, allowing for non-linear execution.

A game program typically consists of an initialization sequence where one-time setup instructions are executed. Following this, the program enters a persistent loop, often referred to as the update routine. Within this loop, the program cycles through a series of operations, including capturing user input, advancing the game's state, and rendering objects.

In GB BASIC, there are two update modes, manual mode and auto mode. In manual mode, programmers are in charge of explicitly invoking an `update` call at the close of each loop iteration to signal the completion of the current frame and allow the runtime to update internal states. In contrast, auto mode, as its name implies, does not require `update` call or in-code update loop, as the runtime handles these operations automatically.

By default, GB BASIC operates in the manual mode. The command `auto update on` enables the auto mode, while `auto update off` disables it.

[TOP](#reference-manual)

## Programming Paradigm

GB BASIC is a programming language that was born in the modern era with retro flavours. It implements the following programming paradigms.

* Imperative paradigm
  * Non-structured programming
  * Concurrent processing approach
* Declarative paradigm
  * Data driven approach

The imperative paradigm is one of the historically early programming paradigms. It features close relation to machine architecture. In this paradigm, a programmer have to tell a computer system exact steps to do. In particular with the use of non-structured programming in GB BASIC, it is capable of creating Turing-complete algorithms. However GB BASIC is not "pure" non-structured, it has mixed with a few structured constructs of selection (`if` and `select case`) and repetition (`for`, `while` and `repeat`) etc. Moreover GB BASIC implements a simple threading feature for being possible and easier of doing concurrent processing.

The declarative paradigm is a style of way to program a computer system with "what to do" rather than "how to do", in GB BASIC this is achieved with a few specialized statements that follow the data driven approach. This approach uses data instead of instructions to indicate a program's behaviour, those data are mostly produced within the asset editors in GB BASIC.

[TOP](#reference-manual)

## Syntax

Projects are programmed in a BASIC dialect. The language implements a classic style syntax that supports code lines either with or without line numbers. A long line can be separated into several short ones, and connected with underscores (`_`). Keywords and identifiers are case-insensitive by default, i.e. `foo`, `Foo` and `FOO` all mean the same, but it could be changed to case-sensitive in project's property.

The target running system of GB BASIC has quite restricted resources, so to satisfy such restrictions, the syntax is designed to be very compact, so that code and assets can be straightforward compiled and processed into the target format very fast and efficient.

This document uses elements such as identifiers, delimiters, and symbols to represent code. Additionally, it uses some symbols that do not appear in formal code to denote additional rules, for example:

* `=`: used in prefix form to denote a function call with a return value, i.e. `=foo()`
* `=?`: used in parameter list to denote a default value when it's omitted, i.e. `foo(a, b=1, c=2)`
* `[]`: denotes optional parameters, i.e. `foo(a[, b[, c]])`
* `...`: indicates a variable number of arguments, i.e. `foo(a, b, ...)`
* `|`: represents "or", i.e. `foo|bar`
* `/`: represents structured syntax that code elements should match, i.e. `foo/end foo`
* `*`: represents a repetition of a code element, i.e. `foo*`
* `#pg`: represents a code page or asset page
* `#pg:n`: represents a code page or asset page with a specific sub index
* `"{builtin}"`: represents name of a builtin entry
* `"{name}"`: represents asset name

[TOP](#reference-manual)

### Comment

Comments will not be compiled into final ROM, they are sidenotes that explain a program to a programmer. A comment starts with a `'` mark or a `REM` statement till the end of that line.

Comment example:

```bas
' Comment.
REM Comment after REMark.
```

### Output

* `print ...`: outputs numeric values to the screen as plain text
  * `...`: variadic data; numeric values separated by comma
* `print fmt[, ...]`: outputs text and numeric values to the screen as plain text
  * `fmt`: the format string, accepts the following "Escapes" for value interpretation
  * `...`: optional variadic data; numeric values separated by comma

Every `print` outputs a newline by default after all contents have been printed, to let the next `print` starts from the same line instead of a new line, put a semicolon (`;`) at the end of the `print`.

| Escapes  | Can be applied to                         | Note                                            |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `%d`     | `print`, `text`, `label`, `menu`, `shell` | Integer (DEC)                                   |
| `%x`     | `print`, `text`, `label`, `menu`, `shell` | Integer (HEX)                                   |
| `%c`     | `print`, `text`, `label`, `menu`, `shell` | Character                                       |
| `%%`     | `print`, `text`, `label`, `menu`, `shell` | Percent sign                                    |
| `\uXXXX` | `print`, `text`, `label`, `menu`, `shell` | Embedded character code, `XXXX` is in HEX       |
| `\#`     | `print`, `text`, `label`, `menu`, `shell` | The current stack pointer of the current thread |
| `\\`     | `print`, `text`, `label`, `menu`, `shell` | Backslash                                       |
| `\r`     | `label`                                   | Carriage return                                 |
| `\n`     | `label`                                   | New line                                        |
| `\f`     | `label`                                   | New page                                        |

The "Escapes" rules apply to one or more of the following: `print fmt[, ...]`, `text fmt[, ...]`, `label #pg|"{name}", fmt[, ...]`, `menu #pg|"{name}", fmt0[, fmt1, ..., fmtN][, ...]`, and `shell ">fmt"[, ...]`.

* `locate x, y`: puts the cursor to the specific location on the screen for text output
  * `x`: the x location in pixels
  * `y`: the y location in pixels

### Jump

* `goto lno|lbl|#pg:lno|#pg:lbl`: performs an unconditional jump to transfer the execution to the specific location
  * objectives:
    * `lno`: line number
    * `lbl`: code line label
    * `#pg:lno`: code page index and line number
    * `#pg:lbl`: code page index and code line label

Jump example:

```bas
loop:
  print "Hello"
  goto loop
```

**See also:** _[Lookup Priority of Labeled Destination](#lookup-priority-of-labeled-destination)._

### Declaration and Expression

* `let foo`: declares a variable without assignment
* `let bar = 42`: declares a variable and assigns a value to it

Each variable declaration takes one word (two bytes) of allocated space in memory.

An expression is a syntactic entity that may be evaluated to determine its value. It is a combination of one or more constants, variables, functions and operators that GB BASIC interprets (according to the particular rules of precedence and of association) and computes to produce ("to return", in a stateful environment) another value. See the following table for all supported operators and their usages. High priorities (with larger numbers) are evaluated before low ones (with smaller numbers).

| Operators | Priority | Note                          | Example       |
|-----------|----------|-------------------------------|---------------|
| `+`       | 3        | Add                           | `a + b`       |

### Data Types

There are two fundamental data types in GB BASIC, String and Integer. Besides, it also supports Byte, Boolean, ID and Nothing, which are just type aliases of Integer, the purpose of these aliases is that they indicate different semantic meanings.

* String
  * is used by `print`, `text`, `label`, etc. for literal text or formatting
* Integer (16-bit signed)
  * denotes most of the numeric data in GB BASIC
* Byte (8-bit signed/unsigned)
  * is used by `data` statements to denote inline data sequences
* Boolean
  * has two values, `false` and `true`
* ID
  * denotes particular object instance
* Nothing
  * has one value, `nothing`, representing "no available object", etc.

#### Memory Management

All the data types including ID are value-types in the language. In other words memory of variables per se are managed by GB BASIC itself rather than by a programmer. But the object "value" referenced by an ID "variable" is not always automatically managed.

Thus a programmer is in charge of creating and deleting objects properly, or there will be memory leak. In particular, "actor" should be deleted when it's no longer in use; however "projectile" will be automatically collected when it's no longer alive; and "trigger" is array based, it will be collected when scene unloads, system shuts down, or shrunk manually.

Do not assume that the allocated ID values of threads, actors, and projectiles remain constant across different versions of GB BASIC.

#### Number Calculation

The runtime of GB BASIC emulates an 8-bit CPU with limited processing power, making floating-point calculations costly. To optimize running speed, GB BASIC represents all numeric data as integers, specifically 16-bit signed integers. But what about operations like speed accumulation? To address this, GB BASIC employs scaled integers. For example, an actor's movement speed is scaled by 1/16. Therefore, a movement speed value of 16 for an actor indicates a speed of 1x, a value of 1 signifies 1/16x, and 32 represents 2x, and so on.

#### Trigonometric Functions

Due to the integer nature of GB BASIC, the domain of angle values and related trigonometric functions is mapped from "0° to 360°" to "0 to 256", and the range of sine and cosine trigonometric functions is mapped from "-1.0 to 1.0" to "-127 to 127".

| Degree | GB BASIC representation | Sine | Cosine |
|--------|-------------------------|------|--------|
|   0°   |   0                     |    0 |  127   |
|   1°   |   0                     |    3 |  127   |
|   2°   |   1                     |    6 |  127   |
| ...    | ...                     |  ... |  ...   |
|  90°   |  64                     |  127 |    0   |
| ...    | ...                     |  ... |  ...   |
| 180°   | 128                     |    0 | -127   |
| ...    | ...                     |  ... |  ...   |
| 270°   | 192                     | -127 |    0   |
| ...    | ...                     |  ... |  ...   |
| 358°   | 254                     |   -6 |  127   |
| 359°   | 255                     |   -3 |  127   |
| 360°   |   0 (256)               |    0 |  127   |

The `=deg(angle)` function provides a convenient way to map angles with a domain of 0° to 360° to an internal representation ranging from 0 to 256.

### Function

* `call func[, ...]`: calls the specific native function
  * `func`: the native function to call, the name is case-sensitive; can be one of the following "Functions"
  * `...`: optional variadic arguments; numeric values separated by comma

| Functions                 | Alternative | Note                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `call wait_for n`         | `wait n`    | Waits for `n` frames on the current thread                                                                     |
| `call wait_until_confirm` | -           | Waits until the A/Start button has been pressed; or anywhere of the screen has been tapped (extension feature) |
| `call error`              | -           | Raises an error                                                                                                |
| `call camera_shake n, d`  | -           | Shake camera for `n` frames with ["Camera shake directions"](#scene) specified by `d`                          |

<!-- Extra kernels can provide more native functions. -->

* `def fn f(...) = ...`: defines a user function
  * `f`: the user defined function name
  * `...`: the function expression
* `=f(...)`: call a user defined function, where `f` is the user defined function name
  * `...`: arguments passed to the function

Function example:

```bas
def fn f(x, y) = sqr(x) + abs(y)
let a = f(1 + abs(-2), f(1, -3))
```

By default, `fn` functions, like other symbols, are defined in the global scope. Additionally, GB BASIC supports defining local lexical scopes using `begin def/end def`, where an `fn` function is only valid within that specific scope. See the [Macro Scope](#macro-scope) section for detail.

### Macro Constant

* `def c = N`: defines a macro constant, i.e. `def meaningful = 42`
  * `c`: the macro name
  * `N`: numeric constant

Unlike variable or array declaration, the macro constant definition doesn't allocate any memory space.

By default, macro constants defined by `def ... = ...`, like other symbols, are defined in the global scope. Additionally, GB BASIC supports defining local lexical scopes using `begin def/end def`, where a `def ... = ...` macro is only valid within that specific scope. See the [Macro Scope](#macro-scope) section for detail.

In addition to user-defined macro constants, the system also provides several builtin macros that reflect cartridge properties.

| Macro names              | Description                                       | Value             |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `IS_COLORED_CARTRIDGE`   | Whether the cartridge supports color              | `true` or `false` |
| `IS_EXTENSION_CARTRIDGE` | Whether the cartridge supports extension features | `true` or `false` |
| `CARTRIDGE_HAS_SRAM`     | Whether the cartridge has SRAM                    | `true` or `false` |
| `CARTRIDGE_HAS_RTC`      | Whether the cartridge has Real-Time Clock         | `true` or `false` |

These predefined macros are automatically determined at compile time and can be used like regular macro constants. Their values are resolved during compilation and remain fixed throughout the program.

### Identifier Alias

* `def a = b`: defins an identifier alias of variable or array, i.e. `define meaningful = foo`
  * `a`: the macro name
  * `b`: the variable or array name

Unlike variable or array declaration, the macro definition of identifier alias doesn't allocate any memory space.

By default, identifner alias defined by macro `def ... = ...`, like other symbols, are defined in the global scope. Additionally, GB BASIC supports defining local lexical scopes using `begin def/end def`, where a `def ... = ...` macro is only valid within that specific scope. See the [Macro Scope](#macro-scope) section for detail.

### Conditional

Single-line conditional syntax as follows:

* `if/then`: one-line conditional statement with one branch
* `if/then/else`: one-line conditional statement with two branches

```bas
if 1 then print "Ok"
if 0 then print "Oops" else print "Ok"
```

* `if/then N[/else]`: is short for `if/then goto N[/else]`
* `if/goto N[/else]`: is short for `if/then goto N[/else]`

```bas
if 1 then goto somewhere
if 1 then somewhere
if 1 goto somewhere
```

Multiline conditional syntax as follows:

* `if/then/end if`: multiline conditional statement with one branch
* `if/then/else/end if`: multiline conditional statement with two branches
* `if/then/else if*/else/end if`: multiline conditional statement with multiple branches

```bas
if 0 then
  print "Oops"
else if 1 then
  if 1 then
    print "Ok"
  end if
else
  print "Oops"
end if
```

Multi-case selection syntax as follows:

* `select case*/end select`: multi-case selection statement
* `select case*/else/end select`: multi-case selection statement

```bas
select case foo
  case 1
    print "Value"
  case 2, 3
    print "Values"
  case 4 to 5
    print "Range"
  case >= 6
    print "Comparison"
  else
    print "Others"
end select
```

A `select case` statement conditionally executes sections of code depending on the value of a variable. A case condition can be a single value, a number of values, a range of values or a comparison. When the case is determined by a range of values, the smaller number must come before the larger one; when the case is determined by a comparison, it supports `=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` and `<>` operators. The condition variable to be determined cannot be a macro costant or stack reference macro.

`If` and `select case` statements support both modern and retro syntax.

| Modern syntax | Retro syntax |
|---------------|--------------|
| `else if`     | `elseif`     |
| `end if`      | `endif`      |
| `end select`  | `endselect`  |

Ternary conditional operator syntax as follows:

* `=iif(cond, a, b)`: gets one of the two specific values according to the condition
  * `cond`: the condition expression
  * `a`: the expression that results the first value
  * `b`: the expression that results the second value
  * returns the first value if the condition results `true`, otherwise returns the second one

Branched jump syntax as follows:

* `on cond goto|gosub lno|lbl|#pg:lno|#pg:lbl[, ...]`: performs a branched jump according to the condition
  * `cond`: the condition expression; jumps to the first (No. 0) branch if the condition results `0`, to the second (No. 1) branch if it results `1`, and so on...
  * objectives:
    * `lno`: line number
    * `lbl`: code line label
    * `#pg:lno`: code page index and line number
    * `#pg:lbl`: code page index and code line label
  * `...`: optional variadic labels; locations separated by comma

A branch chunk is a routine that takes zero parameter.

```bas
let a = 0
on a goto lbl0, lbl1, lbl2
goto lblElse
lbl0:
  print "0"
  end
lbl1:
  print "1"
  end
lbl2:
  print "2"
  end
lblElse:
  print "Else"
```

### Loop

* `for/to[/step]/next`: repeats a section of code a number of times with a control variable which has a differing value each time through the loop

`For` loop example:

```bas
for i = 0 to 4 step 1
  print "i=%d", i
next
```

* `while/end while`: repeats a section of code while a control condition results `true`

`While` loop example:

```bas
let a = 0
while a < 5
  print "a=%d", a
  a = a + 1
end while
```

`While` statements support both modern and retro syntax.

| Modern syntax | Retro syntax |
|---------------|--------------|
| `end while`   | `wend`       |

* `repeat/until`: repeats a section of code until a control condition results `true`

`Repeat` loop example:

```bas
let a = 0
repeat
  print "a=%d", a
  a = a + 1
until a = 5
```

* `exit`: exits the current loop structure, and continues to execute its following code

### Sub

* `gosub lno|lbl|#pg:lno|#pg:lbl`: pushes the execution point to the stack, then performs an unconditional jump to transfer the execution to the specific location
  * objectives:
    * `lno`: line number
    * `lbl`: code line label
    * `#pg:lno`: code page index and line number
    * `#pg:lbl`: code page index and code line label
* `return`: pops the top execution point from the stack, then returns the execution to the point

Sub example:

```bas
loop:
  gosub lbl
  goto loop

lbl:
  print "Hello"
  return
```

### Thread

* `=start lno|lbl|#pg:lno|#pg:lbl[, ...]`: starts a thread from the specific location
  * objectives:
    * `lno`: line number
    * `lbl`: code line label
    * `#pg:lno`: code page index and line number
    * `#pg:lbl`: code page index and code line label
  * `...`: optional variadic arguments; numeric values separated by comma
  * returns the started thread ID (non-zero), or `nothing` (zero) if fails
* `join id`: joins the specific thread; will return when the thread is finished
  * `id`: the thread ID
* `kill id`: terminates the specific thread
  * `id`: the thread ID
* `kill`: terminates all the other threads except for the current one
* `wait n`: waits for `n` frames on the current thread
  * `n`: the specific frame count to wait
* `lock`: retains and locks exclusive dispatching permission to the current thread, until it is unlocked or terminated
* `unlock`: releases and unlocks exclusive dispatching permission obtained by the current thread

<!-- * `raise code[, ...]`: raises a runtime exception
  * `code`: the exception code
  * `...`: optional variadic arguments; numeric values separated by comma -->

<!-- * `=arg`: **obsolete**, use `=stack(n)` or `=stack0|stack1|...|stackN` instead; gets and pops the value of the head argument passed to the current thread from its caller
  * returns the value of the current argument -->

**Tips:** _Accessing global variables on different concurrent threads is **unsafe**, consider stack references instead. See [Stack Operations](#stack-operations) for details._

Thread example:

```bas
let id = start lbl, 22, 7
update
join id
print "!!!"
end

lbl:
  print "Args: %d, %d", stack1, stack0
  for i = 0 to 4
    print "i=%d", i
    wait 10
  next
  print "End"
```

**See also:** _[Lookup Priority of Labeled Destination](#lookup-priority-of-labeled-destination)._

### Code Block

* `begin do/end do`: marks the beginning and end of a code block

These statements don't execute any specific instructions at runtime, they simply help organize code.

Code block example:

```bas
begin do
  ' Do something.
end do

' Do something else.
```

`Begin do/end do` statements support both modern and retro syntax.

| Modern syntax | Retro syntax |
|---------------|--------------|
| `begin do`    | `begindo`    |
| `end do`      | `enddo`      |

### Macro Scope

* `begin def/end def`: marks the beginning and end of a local lexical scope for macro definitions like function `def fn f(...) = ...`, constant `def c = 42`, alias `def a = b` and stack reference `def s = stackN`

Scoping example:

```bas
' Scope for function macro.
def fn f() = 1
print "f()=%d", f() ' Call the global function.

begin def
  def fn f() = 2
  print "f()=%d", f() ' Call the local function.
end def

print "f()=%d", f() ' Call the global function.
```

```bas
' Scope for macro constant.
def c = 1
print "c=%d", c ' Get the global macro.

begin def
  def c = 2
  print "c=%d", c ' Get the local macro.
end def

print "c=%d", c ' Get the global macro.
```

```bas
' Scope for identifier alias.
let x = 1
let y = 2
def z = x
print "z=%d", z ' Get the global variable.

begin def
  def z = y
  print "z=%d", z ' Get the local variable.
end def

print "z=%d", z ' Get the global variable.
```

```bas
' Scope for stack reference macro.
let foo = 1
let bar = 2
print "foo=%d,bar=%d", foo, bar ' Get the global variables.
let id = start lbl, 22, 7 ' Start the thread.
update
join id
print "foo=%d,bar=%d", foo, bar ' Get the global variables.
end

lbl:
  begin def
    def foo = stack0
    def bar = stack1
    print "foo=%d,bar=%d", foo, bar ' Get the stack variables.
  end def
  end
```

`Begin def/end def` statements support both modern and retro syntax.

| Modern syntax | Retro syntax |
|---------------|--------------|
| `begin def`   | `begindef`   |
| `end def`     | `enddef`     |

### Peek and Poke

* `=peek(pos)`: gets the value at the specific bus address
  * `pos`: the address to access
  * returns the value in byte
* `poke(pos, val)`: sets the value at the specific bus address
  * `pos`: the address to access
  * `val`: the value in byte
* `=peek int(pos)`: gets the value at the specific bus address wordwise
  * `pos`: the address to access
  * returns the value in word (two bytes)
* `poke int(pos, val)`: sets the value at the specific bus address wordwise
  * `pos`: the address to access
  * `val`: the value in word (two bytes)

### Array

GB BASIC supports array of number with up to 4 dimensions. The index is 0-based in each dimension, making its array access behaviour similar to most modern programming languages.

* `dim bar[N[, ...]]`: defines an array with up to 4 dimensions

Each array element takes one word (two bytes) of allocated space in memory.

### Read Data

* `data val[, ...]`: declares a number of byte values as inline data sequence
  * `val`: the 8-bit byte value
  * `...`: variadic data; byte values separated by comma
* `data int val[, ...]`: declares a number of 16-bit integer values for inline data sequence in little-endian, i.e. `data int 0x1234`
  * `val`: the 16-bit integer value
  * `...`: variadic data; integer values separated by comma
* `data repeat val, num`: declares a number of identical numeric values as inline data sequence
  * `val`: the identical value
  * `num`: the data count to repeat

* `read var[, ...]`: reads a number of byte values from declared inline data sequence from the current reading position, moves the reading position one step forward for each read operation
  * `var`: the variable
  * `...`: variadic variables separated by comma
* `read int var[, ...]`: reads a number of 16-bit integer values from inline data sequence in little-endian, i.e. `read int foo`
  * `var`: the variable
  * `...`: variadic variables separated by comma
* `read array`: reads a number of bytes from declared inline data sequence from the current reading position, stores the bytes into the specified array, moves the reading position according to the array size
  * `array`: the array to store the bytes, where each element is an `int` that takes two bytes
* `read n`: skips a number of bytes in the declared inline data sequence from the current reading position, moves the reading position according to the number of bytes to skip
  * `n`: the constant number of bytes to skip

* `restore "{builtin}"|lno|lbl|#pg:lno|#pg:lbl`: restores the reading position of inline data sequence to the specific location
  * objectives:
    * `"{builtin}"`: the name of a builtin entry
    * `lno`: line number
    * `lbl`: code line label
    * `#pg:lno`: code page index and line number
    * `#pg:lbl`: code page index and code line label
* `restore array`: restores the reading position of inline data sequence to the start address of the specific array
  * `array`: the source data array, where each element is an `int` that takes two bytes

GB BASIC also supports to declare 16-bit integer values other than 8-bit ones with the `int` statement, this statement is only used with in a `data` or `read` to declare or read two bytes as one word.

The values following all `data` statements are arranged in increasing order from code page 0 to the following pages, and from the first line to the following lines. Regardless of whether the `data` statement is inside a conditional or loop statement, the sequence of values is processed once and only once. The maximum supported size for the `data` sequence declared in code is approximately 16KB.

### Stack Operations

* `reserve`: reserves a slot on the stack of the current thread
* `reserve n`: reserves a number of slots on the stack of the current thread
  * `n` the number of slots to be reserved

* `push`: pushes a `0` to the stack of the current thread
* `push val`: pushes a value to the stack of the current thread
  * `val`: the value to push

* `=pop`: pops a value from the stack of the current thread
  * returns the popped value

* `=top`: gets the top value of the stack of the current thread, does not change the stack frames
  * returns the top value

* `=stack(n)`: gets the `n`th value of the stack in the order of bottom-up or top-down of the current thread, does not change the stack frames
  * `n`: the integer reference constant, if `n` is greater than or equal to `0` then gets the "stack **bottom** + `n`" value, otherwise `n` is less than `0` then gets the "stack **top** + `n`" value
  * returns the value
* `=stack0|stack1|...|stackN`: gets the specific Nth value of the stack relative to its **bottom** of the current thread, does not change the stack frames
  * returns the value

Alghough the `stack(n)` operation doesn't change the stack frames, outer statements such as assignment or printing may reserve stack space. So consider using positive `n` only within an expression.

**Tips:** _Accessing global variables on different concurrent threads is **unsafe**. For instance, if one thread is reading the value of a global variable while another thread is writing to it, the reading thread may not obtain the correct value as intended. To address this issue, thread locks can be used, or the above mentioned stack operations, `stack(n)` or `stackN`, can be employed to manipulate thread local variables instead of global ones. The specific solution depends on the actual problem._

* `def ... = stack0|stack1|...|stackN`: defines a stack reference with an alias, i.e. `def meaningful = stack0`

Unlike variable or array declaration, the stack reference definition doesn't allocate any memory space.

By default, `stack` references defined by `def ... = stackN`, like other symbols, are defined in the global scope. Additionally, GB BASIC supports defining local lexical scopes using `begin def/end def`, where a `def ... = stackN` reference is only valid within that specific scope. See the [Macro Scope](#macro-scope) section for detail.

### Others

* `=pack(b0, b1)`: packs the two bytes into a 16-bit integer
  * `b0`: the first byte
  * `b1`: the second byte
  * returns the packed 16-bit integer; the bit order is `(B1 LSHIFT 8) BOR (B0)`
* `unpack(val, b0, b1)`: unpacks the 16-bit integer into two bytes and stores them into the two variables
  * `val`: the 16-bit integer to unpack

* `swap var0, var1`: swaps the values of the two variables
  * `var0`: passed by reference; the first variable
  * `var1`: passed by reference; the second variable
* `inc var`: increases the value of the specific variable; this is equivalent to `var = var + 1` but simpler
  * `var`: passed by reference; the variable to operate
* `dec var`: decreases the value of the specific variable; this is equivalent to `var = var - 1` but simpler
  * `var`: passed by reference; the variable to operate

### Image

* `image(first, x, y, w, h, layer = MAP_LAYER) = with tile read|data ...|"{builtin}"|#pg|#pg:n|"{name}"`: draws an image from tiles data
  * `first`: index of the first image tile to write to
  * `x`: the x position in tiles to put the image
  * `y`: the y position in tiles to put the image
  * `w`: the width of the image in tiles
  * `h`: the height of the image in tiles
  * `layer`: the layer to put the image; can be either `MAP_LAYER` or `WINDOW_LAYER` of the "Graphics layers" constants

    * `"{builtin}"`: the name of a builtin entry
    * `#pg`: tiles page index
    * `#pg:n`: tiles page index and tile index
    * `name`: tiles asset name

The `image(...) = with tile ...` function simply draws tiles to the tiles and map area in VRAM.

* `image(first, x, y, layer = MAP_LAYER) = with map #pg|"{name}"`: draws an image from map data and its corresponding tiles
  * `first`: index of the first image tile to write to
  * `x`: the x position in pixels to put the image

  * objectives:
    * `#pg`: map page index
    * `name`: tiles asset name

The `image(...) = with map ...` function draws map and its corresponding tiles to VRAM. It has similar affect with the following code. When a map's "Optimize" option is turned on, the unused tiles are trimmed from the end.

```bas
map on ' Or `window on`, the following map related lines similarly operate either map or window depend on the target layer.

let w = get map width(#pg)
let h = get map height(#pg)
let n = w * h ' In final code, `n` depends on the tiles asset itself and the map's "Optimize" option.
fill tile(first, n) = #pg_t ' `#pg_t` is the map's referenced tiles asset.

map x, y

option VRAM_USAGE, VRAM_ATTRIBUTES ' These two lines only execute when the map's attributes layer is enabled.
def map(0, 0, w, h, first) = #pg:1

option VRAM_USAGE, VRAM_TILES
def map(0, 0, w, h, first) = #pg:0
```

Drawing images will automatically turn on the map or window layer.

### Tiles

* `fill tile(first, n) = read|data ...|"{builtin}"|#pg|#pg:n|"{name}"`: fills the tiles area in VRAM
  * `first`: index of the first tile to write to
  * `n`: the tile count
  * objectives:
    * `"{builtin}"`: the name of a builtin entry
    * `#pg`: tiles page index

  * returns the tile count

The tiles editor can produce tiles assets, press **Ctrl+2/Cmd+2** in edit mode to switch to the tiles tab. GB BASIC allows importing external images and other formats as tiles, besides creating from scratch.

Tiles data for a `fill tile` operation can also come from inline code. This data is arranged one tile after another, line by line; each line has 8 pixels, since each pixel in GB BASIC is 2bpp, a line is encoded by 2 bytes, where a bit from the first byte encodes the lower bit of a pixel, and the corresponding bit from the second byte encodes the higher part.

### Map

* `map on`: turns on the map layer
* `map off`: turns off the map layer

* `map x, y`: puts the map in VRAM on the screen at the specific position
  * `x`: the x position in pixels
  * `y`: the y position in pixels

* `fill map(first, n) = read|data ...|"{builtin}"|#pg|#pg:n|"{name}"`: fills the map area in VRAM; this is equivalent to a `fill tile` operation
  * `first`: index of the first map tile to write to
  * `n`: the tile count
  * objectives:
    * `"{builtin}"`: the name of a builtin entry
    * `#pg`: tiles page index
    * `#pg:n`: tiles page index and tile index
    * `name`: tiles asset name
* `def map(x, y, w, h, base_tile = 0[, pitch][, offset]) = read|data ...|"{builtin}"|#pg|#pg:n|"{name}"`: defines the map area in VRAM
  * `x`: the x position in tiles in both the source tile map and hardware background map tile coordinates, with range of values from 0 to 255
  * `y`: the y position in tiles in both the source tile map and hardware background map tile coordinates, with range of values from 0 to 255
  * `w`: the width of area to set in tiles, with range of values from 1 to 255
  * `h`: the height of area to set in tiles, with range of values from 1 to 255
  * `base_tile`: the start index for map tiles
  * `pitch`: the number of tiles in a row of the map, omit to use the source width

    * `"{builtin}"`: the name of a builtin entry
    * `#pg`: map page index
    * `#pg:n`: map page index and map layer
    * `name`: tiles asset name

In order to transfer map data in a way where the coordinates are not aligned, an offset from the source data address can be passed in `-(x + y * pitch)`; i.e. to draw source tiles start from (0, 0) to the destination area starts from (8, 7), then offset the source address with `-(8 + 7 * map_width)`.

* `=get map width(#pg|"{name}")`: gets the width in tiles of the specific map asset page
  * objectives:
    * `#pg`: map page index
    * `name`: map asset name
  * returns the width in tiles

    * `name`: map asset name
  * returns the height in tiles

* `=get map(x, y)`: gets the tile value of the current map at the specific position
  * `x`: the x position in tiles
  * `y`: the y position in tiles
  * returns the tile value
* `set map(x, y) = val`: sets the tile value of the current map at the specific position
  * `x`: the x position in tiles
  * `y`: the y position in tiles
  * `val`: the tile value

The map editor can produce map assets, press **Ctrl+3/Cmd+3** in edit mode to switch to the map tab. GB BASIC allows importing external formats as map, besides creating from scratch.

The hardware VRAM's map area is limited to 32x32 tiles. Although a map asset can be defined larger than this size in the asset editor, using the aforementioned map statements to fill the map will cause data to exceed this area. For complex scenes, consider using the [Scene](#scene) feature to support large maps, map scrolling, scene property definitions, object definitions, and more.

Map data for a `def map` operation can also come from inline code. This data is arranged one tile after another, from left to right and top to down.

### Sprite

* `sprite off`: turns off the sprite layer

* `sprite id, x, y`: draws the sprite in VRAM to the screen at the specific position

  * `id`: the sprite ID
  * `prop`: the property type; can be one of the following "Sprite properties" constants

| `HIDDEN_PROP`     | Boolean    | `false`           | Whether the sprite is hidden or visible                    |

There is no dedicated builtin editor for producing sprite assets. Since sprite data is actually just tile slices, it accepts all kinds of tiles data as its content, and indexes this data for appearance.

### Scene

The scene editor can produce scene assets, press **Ctrl+4/Cmd+4** in edit mode to switch to the scene tab. GB BASIC allows importing external formats as scene, besides creating from scratch.

Scene data for a `def scene` operation can also come from inline code. This data is arranged with a header byte for layers mask (with range of values of the following "Scene layers" constants), then one layer after another according to the order of map, attributes and properties.

    * `#pg:lbl`: code page index and code line label
  * **see also:** _[Cheat Sheet of Collision Rules](#cheat-sheet-of-collision-rules)._
* `off actor(id) hits`: unregisters a callback for when the specific actor hits another one or a projectile
  * `id`: the actor ID

**Tips:** _All threads associated with an actor will be terminated after the actor is destroyed. For instance, using `del actor(...)` to delete the associated actor in one of the actor's threads will result in the subsequent code in this thread no longer being executed._

An actor's behaving (`start`) routine is a routine that takes one parameter for the actor itself. See the following routine signature for detail.

* signature of behaving routine `(a)`
  * `a`: the actor ID

An actor's `hits` callback is a routine that takes two parameters for the first and second objects respectively that collide with each other by default; it can also accept two extra parameters for target's collision group and hit direction, when the `ACTOR_HIT_WITH_DETAILS_ENABLED` feature is enabled, the direction value represents the direction from the first object toward the second object. When an actor collides with another, the first two parameters are both actors, when an actor collides with a projectile, the former is the actor and the latter is the projectile. An actor only collides with projectiles that share overlapping collision bits. See the following callback signature for detail.

* signature of `hits` callback `(obj0, obj1[, group, dir])`
  * `obj0`: the first object, either actor or projectile
  * `obj1`: the second object, either actor or projectile
  * `group`: the collision group of the second object; this is only available when the `ACTOR_HIT_WITH_DETAILS_ENABLED` feature is enabled
  * `dir`: the hit direction; this is only available when the `ACTOR_HIT_WITH_DETAILS_ENABLED` feature is enabled

All hit callbacks by `goto`, `gosub` and `start` work with the manual update mode, and only callbacks by `start` work with the auto update mode.

Actor assets' default behave threads and hit callbacks can be binded in the actor editor, the bindings will be assigned automatically during scene loading. These bindings can then be overridden for specific actor instances in the scene editor.

The actor editor can produce actor assets, press **Ctrl+5/Cmd+5** in edit mode to switch to the actor/projectile tab. GB BASIC allows importing external formats as actor/projectile, besides creating from scratch.

Actor data (frame, animations, animation) can also come from inline code. These data is arranged as following respectively. For frame data: it comes one sprite unit after another; in every unit, it is arranged as y offset from previous unit, x offset from previous unit, tile index, properties; it comes with an end mark (-128) at the end of the current frame. For animations data: it starts with a base index and frame count to fill in; then it comes one frame after another; in every frame, it is arranged as begin frame index plus end frame index. For animation data: it comes with an index pointing to the desired motion.

### Actor Controllers

The following actor controllers are appliable to an actor to indicate its behaviours and interactions with other objects or a scene.

| Actor behaviours                          | Note                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NONE_BEHAVIOUR`                          | An actor with this value behaves nothing                                                              |
| `PLATFORMER_PLAYER_BEHAVIOUR`             | An actor with this value behaves as a player controlled platformer character                          |
| `PLATFORMER_MOVE_BEHAVIOUR`               | An actor with this value behaves as a moving platformer character, not required to `move actor`       |
| `PLATFORMER_IDLE_BEHAVIOUR`               | An actor with this value behaves as an idle platformer character, not required for a non-moving actor |
| `TOPDOWN_PLAYER_BEHAVIOUR`                | An actor with this value behaves as a player controlled topdown character                             |
| `TOPDOWN_MOVE_BEHAVIOUR`                  | An actor with this value behaves as a moving topdown character, not required to `move actor`          |
| `TOPDOWN_IDLE_BEHAVIOUR`                  | An actor with this value behaves as an idle topdown character, not required for a non-moving actor    |
| `POINTNCLICK_PLAYER_BEHAVIOUR`            | An actor with this value behaves as a player controlled point&click character                         |
| `POINTNCLICK_PLAYER_WITH_MOUSE_BEHAVIOUR` | An actor with this value behaves as a player controlled point&click character with mouse support      |
| `POINTNCLICK_PLAYER_WITH_TOUCH_BEHAVIOUR` | An actor with this value behaves as a player controlled point&click character with touch support      |

Both `POINTNCLICK_PLAYER_WITH_MOUSE_BEHAVIOUR` and `POINTNCLICK_PLAYER_WITH_TOUCH_BEHAVIOUR` controllers support obtaining user input from pointing devices, and will fall back to `POINTNCLICK_PLAYER_BEHAVIOUR` if no such device is available. The difference between the two lies in the fact that the "mouse"-driven behaviour moves a small distance according to the movement speed towards the input point each time, while the "touch"-driven behaviour moves immediately to the input point location.

<!-- Extra kernels can provide more controllers. -->

### Emote

The drawing elements of an emote consist of hardware sprites and their associated tiles. The emote module raises small icons represented by 2x2 tiles, these icons are often used to express highlights and other emotions of characters. An emotion icon takes two 8x16 sprites, which the right half can be mirrored from the left if the mirrored flag is specified.

* `emote(x, y, base_tile = 0, mirrored = false[, pal]) = read|data ...|"{builtin}"|#pg|"{name}"`: emotes with the specific tiles data

    * `name`: tiles asset name

### Projectile

The drawing elements of a projectile consist of hardware sprites and their associated tiles. A projectile instance must be launched (with `start projectile`) from a template (defined with `def projectile`). GB BASIC supports up to 5 projectile templates and instances respectively.

* `fill projectile(first, n) = read|data ...|"{builtin}"|#pg|#pg:n|"{name}"`: fills the projectile area in VRAM; this is equivalent to a `fill sprite` operation

**Tips:** _A projectile only collides with actors that share overlapping collision bits. And if a projectile's collision group property is equivalent to its launcher actor's, they may trigger an unexpected hit callback instantly on launching._

The actor editor can produce projectile assets, press **Ctrl+5/Cmd+5** in edit mode to switch to the actor/projectile tab. GB BASIC allows importing external formats as actor/projectile, besides creating from scratch.

Projectile data (frame, animations, etc.) can also come from inline code. These data is arranged as following respectively. For frame data: it comes one sprite unit after another; in every unit, it is arranged as y offset from previous unit, x offset from previous unit, tile index, properties; it comes with an end mark (-128) at the end of the current frame. For animations data: it starts with a base index and frame count to fill in; then it comes one frame after another; in every frame, it is arranged as begin frame index plus end frame index.

#### Widgets

GB BASIC supports three GUI widgets: [label](#label-widget), [progress bar](#progressbar-widget), and [menu](#menu-widget). The following sections will provide a detailed explanation. This sections gives some overall information.

* `def widget() = nothing`: undefines widget; this only resets the widget states, but does not resets graphics elements and VRAM

All GUI widgets share a same subset of rumtime states, so consider manipulating only one widget at a time, or redefining before putting/drawing across multiple threads or mixed invokings.

**See also:** _[Cheat Sheet of GUI Widgets](#cheat-sheet-of-gui-widgets)._

## Extension Features

The extension features are enabled by default. Changing the cartridge type to a non-extension type in project properties before building can produce more compatible ROM.

**See also:** _[Cheat Sheet of Devices](#cheat-sheet-of-devices)._

### Platform Detection

Query device with `PLATFORM_FLAGS` or read from memory address `0xFEA1` to get the platform dependent flags, and then use the following code to check if the program is running on a specific platform.

```bas
let flags = query(PLATFORM_FLAGS) ' or `peek(0xFEA1)`.

let os = flags band 0b00001111
select case os
  case 0b00000001
    print " OS: Windows"
  case 0b00000010
    print " OS: Linux"
  case 0b00000100
    print " OS: MacOS"
  case 0b00001000
    print " OS: HTML"
  else
    print " OS: Unknown"
end select

if flags band 0b10000000 then
  print "Env: Editor"
else
  print "Env: Emulator"
end if
```

### Mouse and Touch

_The "touch" API family supports direct interaction with GB BASIC programs on the screen through pointing devices. The introduction of this extended feature stems from a thought of mine: what could we do if we were to reinterpret old handheld consoles from a modern perspective?_

* `=touch()`: gets whether any touch pointer is being pressed
  * returns non-zero for the touch/mouse button type if any touch pointer is being pressed, otherwise `0x00`; can be one of the following "Mouse buttons" constants
* `=touch(x, y)`: gets whether any touch pointer is being pressed
  * `x`: passed by reference; a variable to store the x position in pixels
  * `y`: passed by reference; a variable to store the y position in pixels
  * returns non-zero for the touch/mouse button type if any touch pointer is being pressed, otherwise `0x00`; can be one of the following "Mouse buttons" constants
* `=touchd()`: gets whether any touch pointer has just been pressed
  * returns non-zero for the touch/mouse button type if any touch pointer has just been pressed, otherwise `0x00`; can be one of the following "Mouse buttons" constants

A touch callback is a routine that takes three parameters respectively for x, y of the touch position, and a third parameter for the source button type (can be one of the "Mouse buttons" constants) if it's triggered by a mouse. See the following callback signature for detail.

* signature of touch callback `(x, y, b)`
  * `x`: x position in pixels
  * `y`: y position in pixels
  * `b`: source button type (can be one of the "Mouse buttons" constants)

All touch callbacks by `goto`, `gosub` and `start` work with the manual update mode, and only callbacks by `start` work with the auto update mode.

### Keyboard Input

_The keyboard input feature (experimental) supports transfering key codes and modifiers from the host environment to the VM, which allows GB BASIC users to interact with it not limited to the eight buttons._

There are two special registers that can be used to get the status of the key modifiers and the last pressed key code.

| Addresses | Name   | Description                    | Access     |
|-----------|--------|--------------------------------|------------|
| 0xFEA8    | `KEYM` | Key modifier flags             | Read-only  |
| 0xFEA9    | `KEYC` | First valid key code in buffer | Read/write |

* `KEYM`: the key modifier flags, `0x00` for no pressing, `0x01` for **Ctrl**, `0x02` for **Shift**, `0x04` for **Alt**, `0x08` for **Meta**, and these bits can be combined
* `KEYC`: the key code, with range of values from 0 to 255, `0x00` for no key pressed; after reading, also write `0x00` to it to acknowledge to accept more key codes

`Peek` the `KEYM` register to get the key modifiers. `Peek` the `KEYC` register to get the last pressed key code, then `poke` the `KEYC` register to `0x00` to acknowledge to accept more key codes, i.e.

```bas
def KEYM = 0xFEA8
def KEYC = 0xFEA9

loop:
  let k = peek(KEYC)   ' Get the key code.
  if k <> 0 then       ' If a key code is available.
    let m = peek(KEYM) ' Get the key modifiers.
    print "Key pressed %d, %x", k, m
    poke KEYC, 0       ' Clear the key code, and acknowledge to accept more key codes.
  end if
  update
  goto loop
```

**See also:** _[Key codes](https://paladin-t.github.io/kits/gbb/extensions.html#keyboard-input)._

### Streaming

The "streaming" API supports transfering binary data from the VM to the host environment, then the host environment will save the transfered data to a file.

* `stream val`: streams one byte to the host environment
  * `val`: the byte value to be transferred, with range of values from 0 to 255
* `stream end`: indicates end-of-stream

### Shell Command

* `shell cmd`: executes the specific shell command
  * `cmd`: the shell command string

If `cmd` starts with "http://" or "https://", it will be treated as a URL and an attempt will be made to open the URL. If it starts with "file://", it will be treated as a file path and an attempt will be made to browse that path. Otherwise, it will be treated as a command-line command and an attempt will be made to execute the command.

#### Emulation Control

* `shell "||"`: executes a specialized command to pause emulation
  * `||`: required to indicate for pause
* `shell "[]"`: executes a specialized command to stop emulation
  * `[]`: required to indicate for stop

This is a specialized version of the `shell` command to control emulation.

#### Debugging

* `shell ">fmt"[, ...]`: executes a specialized command for debug
  * `>`: required to indicate for debug
  * `fmt`: the format string, accepts the `print` "Escapes" for value interpretation
  * `...`: variadic data; numeric values separated by comma

This is a specialized version of the `shell` command for outputing some values in a running program to the GB BASIC window, i.e. `shell ">debug %d", n`.

#### Setting Mouse Cursor

* `shell "^type"`: sets the mouse cursor type
  * `^`: required to indicate for cursor preference
  * `type`: the cursor type; can be one of the following "Mouse cursors" constants

| Mouse cursors | Note                |
|---------------|---------------------|
| `NONE`        | No cursor           |
| `POINTER`     | A regular pointer   |
| `HAND`        | Often for clickable |
| `BUSY`        | For busy            |

This is a specialized version of the `shell` command for setting the mouse cursor when it hovers on the emulation area.

#### Syncing Modules

* `shell "@{module}"`: syncs the specific module
  * `"@{module}"`: the module name to sync; can be one of the following "Modules"

| Modules   | Note        |
|-----------|-------------|
| `"@sram"` | SRAM module |

For the moment only SRAM module is supported - `shell "@sram"` - this command notifies the emulator to save the SRAM. While not strictly required, it is recommended to ensure that the SRAM is saved when running within a GB BASIC emulator as part of an HTML export. Leaving this line unchanged is safe for other hardware and platforms.

This is a specialized version of the `shell` command for syncing modules.

# Appendix

## Lookup Priority of Labeled Destination

The `goto`, `gosub`, and `start` statements can take both line number-based and label-based destinations. When using label-based destinations, the following priority rules apply:

| Destinations              | Priority | Note                                    | Example                                                                                |
|---------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Explicitly paged label    | 3        | Looks for precise destination           | Page M: `lbl: ...`; page N: `goto #M:lbl`                                              |
| Label in the same page    | 2        | Looks for near destination              | Page M: `lbl: ...`; in the same page: `goto lbl`                                       |
| Non-ambiguous short label | 1        | Looks for non-ambiguous far destination | Page M: `lbl: ...`; page N: `goto lbl`, where `lbl` is not ambiguous in all code pages |

Higher priorities (larger numbers) take precedence over lower priorities (smaller numbers).
