# Adding Game Logic

[Prev]() [Next]()

In the next few sections, we will add functionality to our minimal game framework to accept user input, then change the game update method from manual to auto mode, and finally enhance the game logic so that the player can use input to control a small character moving on the screen. Eventually, we will have a program that allows for rudimentary "interaction".

In the next section, we will replace the existing character resources with visual assets.
