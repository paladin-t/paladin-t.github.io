This section explains the basic concepts of the video module.

## VRAM Memory Map

The Game Boy uses a unified memory bus. For hardware details about VRAM, refer to: [VRAM Memory Map](memory-map.html#vram-memory-map), and [CGB Features](memory-map.html#cgb-features).

## Palette Layout

On Game Boy, the smallest unit on the screen is a pixel, and each pixel is represented by a 2-bit value, meaning we can say each pixel has a color depth of 4.

| Value | Color      |
|-------|------------|
| 0     | White      |
| 1     | Light gray |
| 2     | Dark gray  |
| 3     | Black      |

On the DMG model, this means we can use 4 shades of gray. On the CGB, we can select a palette for a specific tile, with the pixel value determining which color to use.

### Addresses

* Monochrome palettes
  * BG palette data: 0xFF47 (BGP, Non-CGB mode only)
  * OBJ palette 0, 1 data: 0xFF48-0xFF49 (OBP0, OBP1, non-CGB mode only)
* Color palettes
  * Background color palette specification/background palette index: 0xFF68 (BCPS/BGPI, CGB mode only)
  * Background color palette data/background palette data: 0xFF69 (BCPD/BGPD, CGB mode only)
  * OBJ color palette specification/OBJ palette index, OBJ color palette data/OBJ palette data: 0xFF6A-0xFF6B (OCPS/OBPI, OCPD/OBPD, CGB mode only)

## Tiles Layout

Unlike modern computer systems, the GB's PPU is not well-suited for drawing each frame of the game screen pixel by pixel. Although you can do this, like other machines of that era, the GB's graphical primitives are optimized with tiles. Each tile consists of 8x8 pixels. Maps, sprites, scenes, actors, projectiles, etc. are all composed of tiles as patterns.

### Tile Data

We already have it in mind that each pixel on the GB is represented by 2 bits. Each tile (i.e. 8x8 pixels) is divided into 8 rows, with each row's 8 pixels represented by 8 bits * 2 = 16 bits = 2 bytes. This means each row is represented by 2 bytes, with each bit of these two bytes representing the high and low bit depth values of a pixel respectively. Eight such pairs of bytes, i.e. 16 bytes, form one tile.

As shown in the image below, the first row of the tile is represented by the binary values `0b11111111` and `0b00000001`, which is `0xff`, `0x01`. The entire tile follows this rule.

### Tile Map

In VRAM, each bank has 256 tile graphic units indexed from 0 to 255 as source tiles for map data, and another set of 256 units indexed from 0 to 255 as source for sprite data. The latter 128 elements of both map tiles and sprite ones are shared by maps and sprites in an overlapped space.

### Addresses

| Tile usages         | Block 0 - 0x8000-0x87FF | Block 1 - 0x8800-0x8FFF | Block 2 - 0x9000-0x97FF |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Sprites             | 0-127                   | 128-255                 | -                       |
| BG/Win, if LCDC.4=1 | 0-127                   | 128-255                 | -                       |
| BG/Win, if LCDC.4=0 | -                       | 128-255                 | 0-127                   |

## Map Layout

The map is a contiguous area in VRAM where each element is an index reference to a tile, and references to tiles are arranged in order from left to right and top to bottom.

The Game Boy contains two 32×32 tile maps in VRAM, and these maps can be used to display the background or the window layer. In advanced graphical objects such as scenes, the viewport scrolls over these tile units, recycling them to display a scene much larger than the screen. These tiles are dynamically loaded as the viewport moves.

### Addresses

* 0x9800-0x9BFF
* 0x9C00-0x9FFF

## Sprite Layout

The Game Boy can display up to 40 movable objects (or sprites), each 8×8 or 8×16 pixels. And up to 10 per scanline. Sprites are rendered based on their index references to tiles.

In advanced graphical objects such as actors, multiple animation frames and each frame itself can be composed of multiple underlying sprites. These 40 hardware sprite units are automatically and dynamically allocated to different actor frames.

  <span class="content-text">
    At any given time, all sprites/actors in the scene must use either the 8x8 or 8x16 pixel size; these two sizes cannot be mixed. All 8x16 sprites are aligned to 2 tiles when referencing to them, meaning the starting tile index for each 8x16 sprite should be an even number.
