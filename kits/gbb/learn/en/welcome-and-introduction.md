**GameBuilder BASIC** (**GB BASIC**) is a retro Fantasy Console that generates ROMs compatible with the popular handheld game console. It has everything ready-to-use for writting code, making assets, compiling projects, running with the built-in emulator, exporting to runnable ROM, etc.

## About This Tutorial Series

<div class="content-warn">
  <em>This tutorial series is currently still a draft and is being written.</em>

GB BASIC has a [Reference Manual](https://paladin-t.github.io/kits/gbb/manual.html) that details its syntax and API, which is primarily for handy reference and lookup. This tutorial series aims to provide more beginner-friendly and intuitive guides to help newcomers get started quickly with GB BASIC, and will also cover some advanced features.

You don't have to read these tutorials word-for-word; you can pick and choose the parts that interest you. Below is a general guide to the chapters:

* **Chapters I to VI** are the basic tutorials, suitable for beginners. They introduce the fundamental concepts and usage of GB BASIC, including how to write code, basic data types, the memory model, the hardware, program structure and threading. Please ensure you have a basic understanding of the concepts in these chapters before proceeding.
* **Chapter VII** uses a practical project to demonstrate how to build a typical minimal game framework. This chapter will walk you through creating a basic game flow from scratch. This approach is not the only way, but it is a recommended practice.
* **Chapters VIII to IX** are intermediate tutorials, suitable for readers with some foundational knowledge. They introduce more advanced concepts and techniques, including how to use Scenes, Triggers, Actors, Projectiles, Emotes, colored features, and assign Controllers to Actors. Mastering these chapters is essential for writing more complex and engaging games.
* **Chapter X** uses a practical project to demonstrate how to create a more complex game. This chapter provides a step-by-step guide to creating, organizing, and using advanced resources.
* **Chapters XI to XIII** are intermediate tutorials, suitable for readers with some foundational knowledge. They cover modules for music, sound effects, fonts and Unicode handling, GUI, and how to use these modules to create a more immersive game experience.
* **Chapter XIV** uses several practical projects to demonstrate how to write specific types of games, such as platformers, top-down games, and point-and-click adventures.
* **Chapters XV to XVI** are advanced tutorials. They teach advanced features like persistence and using the RTC (Real-Time Clock), and also cover low-level operations such as direct memory access, graphics primitives, tile manipulation, user input handling, camera control, and extension features, etc.
* **Chapter XVII** is an advanced tutorial that teaches how to debug programs and publish your own ROMs.
* **Chapter XVIII** is an appendix listing some built-in starter kits.
* **Chapter XIX** is an appendix explaining the compiler and kernel architectures.
* **Chapter XX** is an appendix explaining how to create a custom kernel.

This tutorial series is written in English. For the moment, it contains a machine translation mechanism. You can switch languages at any time by clicking the translator widget on the web page, and choose your preference.
