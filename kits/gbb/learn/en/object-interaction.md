# Object Interaction

[Prev]() [Next]()

Interactions between actor objects and the map, such as an actor being blocked by or passing through specific tiles, jumping, falling according to gravity, climbing ladders, or snapping to tiles while moving, are determined by the following conditions:

* The gravity, jump, and climb propert settings of a scene asset
* The behaviour (controller) settings of an actor asset

Knowledge about these behaviours will be explained in [Actor Behaviours](page-not-found.html).

This section focuses on the interaction behaviour and logic between objects, such as collisions between actors, collisions between actors and triggers, and collisions between actors and projectiles.
