# Actor Behaviours

[Prev]() [Next]()

In the previous chapter, we've learned about the scene and advanced game objects in GB BASIC. This chapter focuses on the knowledge, APIs, and best practices related to actor behaviours, which are essential for creating dynamic and vivid actors.

By reading through this chapter, you will get sufficient information about controlling actors with or without controllers, as player characters or non-player ones.
