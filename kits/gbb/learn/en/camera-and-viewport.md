# Camera and Viewport

If an actor's "Following" property is set to on, and this actor has a behaviour controller that supports camera following, then when it moves, the camera will automatically follow and move together. Additionally, the scene has a "Camera dead zone" property. By setting a value greater than 0, it can set a dead zone area for the automatically following camera. The camera will only start moving when the actor moves to the boundary of this range.
