## Getting and Setting Scene Properties

* `=get scene width(#pg|"{name}")`: gets the width in tiles of the specific asset page
  * objectives:
    * `#pg`: scene page index
    * `name`: scene asset name
  * returns the width in tiles
* `=get scene height(#pg|"{name}")`: gets the height in tiles of the specific asset page
  * objectives:
    * `#pg`: scene page index
    * `name`: scene asset name
  * returns the height in tiles
* `=get scene property(x, y, prop)`: gets the scene property at the specific position
  * `x`: the x position in tiles
  * `y`: the y position in tiles
  * `prop`: the property type; can be one of the following "Blocking properties" constants
  * returns the property value
* `=get scene property(prop)`: gets the specific scene property
  * `prop`: the property type; can be one of the following "Scene properties" constants
  * returns the property value
* `set scene property(prop) = val`: sets the specific scene property
  * `prop`: the property type; can be one of the following "Scene properties" constants
  * `val`: the property value
