# Practical Project: Item Collecting

[Prev]() [Next]()

In previous chapters, we learned how to use scenes, objects, and actor controllers. This chapter will walk through a practical project - a simple item collecting game. 

In this game, we'll use the Top-down controller to create the player character and implement item searching and collecting. Through this project, you'll experience common game design and development processes. By flexibly applying what you already know, you can now create substantial projects. Our player character will be able to collect items scattered around the world and talk with an NPC, who will be in charge of counting the items collected by the player.
