These settings allow the specification of multiple palettes for the SGB platform. A border image can also be designated, with dimensions of 256x224px. This border contains a central window matching the game screen size of 160x144px for displaying the game viewport. Full transparency (alpha value of 0) or magenta (#FF00FF) can be used in this image to represent the transparent areas of the window.
