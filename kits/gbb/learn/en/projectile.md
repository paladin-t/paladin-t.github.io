# Projectile

[Prev]() [Next]()

The drawing elements of a projectile consist of hardware sprites and their associated tiles. A projectile instance must be launched (with `start projectile`) from a template (defined with `def projectile`). GB BASIC supports up to 5 projectile templates and instances respectively.

## Making Projectiles

You can create projectile objects in the actor/projectile editor. To make use of projectile resources, instantiate them using code.

### Instantiating Projectiles in Code

To instantiate projectiles in code, fill projectiles' tiles with the `fill projectile` statement; then define projectiles' properties with the `def projectile` statement. And launch projectiles with the `start projectile` statements. For example:

```basic
' Prepare.
sprite on
option SPRITE8x16_ENABLED, true

on btnd(A_BTN) start Launch ' Press A to launch a projectile.

' Fill the projectile tiles.
fill projectile(8, 2) = "BulletTiles"

' Define the projectile.
def projectile property(0, FRAMES_PROP            ) = 0, "Bullet"
def projectile property(0, BOUNDS_LEFT_PROP       ) = 0
def projectile property(0, BOUNDS_TOP_PROP        ) = 0
def projectile property(0, BOUNDS_RIGHT_PROP      ) = 8
def projectile property(0, BOUNDS_BOTTOM_PROP     ) = 8
def projectile property(0, BASE_TILE_PROP         ) = 8
def projectile property(0, ANIMATION_INTERVAL_PROP) = 15
def projectile property(0, ANIMATIONS_PROP        ) = data 0,4, 0,0, 0,0, 0,0, 0,0
def projectile property(0, LIFE_TIME_PROP         ) = 60
def projectile property(0, MOVE_SPEED_PROP        ) = 32
def projectile property(0, INITIAL_OFFSET_PROP    ) = 200
def projectile property(0, COLLISION_GROUP_PROP   ) = 0x01

end

Launch:
  ' Launch a projectile.
  start projectile(0, 80, 72)
  end
```

def projectile property(0, COLLISION_GROUP_PROP   ) = 0x01

end

#### Getting Information of Projectile Assets

* `=len projectile(#pg|"{name}")`: gets the total frame count of the specific projectile

  * objectives:
    * `#pg`: actor/projectile page index
    * `name`: actor/projectile asset name
  * returns the height in pixels

### Launching Projectiles

* `=start projectile(type, x, y, angle = 0, flags = PROJECTILE_NONE_FLAG)`: launches a projectile instance from the specific template
  * `type`: the projectile template type, with range of values from 0 to 4
  * `x`: the x position to launch the projectile
  * `y`: the y position to launch the projectile
  * `angle`: the angle to launch the projectile
  * `flags`: the launching flags, can be a combination of the following "Projectile flags" constants
  * returns the projectile ID
* `=start projectile(type, dx = 0, dy = 0, da = 0, flags = PROJECTILE_NONE_FLAG) with actor(id)`: launches a projectile instance from the specific template with the specific actor's relevant states (position, angle)
  * `type`: the projectile template type, with range of values from 0 to 4
  * `dx`: the offset x position to launch the projectile
  * `dy`: the offset y position to launch the projectile
  * `da`: the offset angle to launch the projectile
  * `flags`: the launching flags, can be a combination of the following "Projectile flags" constants
  * `id`: the actor ID to start with
  * returns the projectile ID

| Projectile flags                    | Note                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PROJECTILE_NONE_FLAG`              | No flag                                                                |
| `PROJECTILE_ANIMATION_NO_LOOP_FLAG` | Whether to loop the projectile's animation                             |
| `PROJECTILE_STRONG_FLAG`            | Whether the projectile would pass through or be destroyed on collision |

**Tips:** _A projectile only collides with actors that share overlapping collision bits. And if a projectile's collision group property is equivalent to its launcher actor's, they may trigger an unexpected hit callback instantly on launching._

The actor editor can produce projectile assets, press **Ctrl+5/Cmd+5** in edit mode to switch to the actor/projectile tab. GB BASIC allows importing external formats as actor/projectile, besides creating from scratch.

Projectile data (frame, animations, etc.) can also come from inline code. These data is arranged as following respectively. For frame data: it comes one sprite unit after another; in every unit, it is arranged as y offset from previous unit, x offset from previous unit, tile index, properties; it comes with an end mark (-128) at the end of the current frame. For animations data: it starts with a base index and frame count to fill in; then it comes one frame after another; in every frame, it is arranged as begin frame index plus end frame index.

Try the following project, which demonstrates how to launch projectiles and interact with them.
