# What Is GB BASIC?

[Prev]() [Next]()

GameBuilder BASIC (GB BASIC) is a game development environment that generates ROMs run on Game Boy and Game Boy Color compatible devices. It is a complete solution for game development, including a programming language, a set of built-in libraries, and a set of handy tools.

## Why Fantasy Console?

Most of the technical specifications are referenced from real hardwares, however GB BASIC also implements a few [extension](https://paladin-t.github.io/kits/gbb/extensions.html#kernel-extension) features which are fictional - such as support for mice, touch screens, keyboards, and some other features that let a GB BASIC program to communicate with outside world. On the other hand, these features are totally implementable, so technically it is possible that we can see these features come true on hardware.

See the [Homepage](https://paladin-t.github.io/kits/gbb/) for more about the technical specs.

## Why Using GB BASIC?

The goal of GB BASIC is to bridge the gap between graphical tools and hardcore C/ASM programming, providing an efficient and comfortable development environment for creators who prefer coding and want quick feedback. It is not only friendly to coding enthusiasts but also features extremely fast compilation, supporting rapid prototyping and iterative development. At the same time, GB BASIC comes with a complete built-in toolchain, allowing developers to focus on the game content itself rather than tedious compilation and debugging processes.

Furthermore, GB BASIC allows developers to freely create and distribute commercial ROMs or physical cartridges. Users retain full copyright of the game projects they develop and the resulting ROM files, with no additional terms or fees.
