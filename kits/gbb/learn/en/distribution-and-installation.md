## Packaging

Typically, a kernel package consists of the following files.

* **.json**: The manifest file, which configures various information about this kernel for installing and using
* **.gb**: The pre-compiled kernel ROM. User programs will use this ROM as the linking source
* **.sym**: The symbol table corresponding to the kernel ROM, generated by the kernel developer when compiling the ROM. It defines the bank and address of symbols such as variables, constants, functions, and resources within the ROM
* **.aliases.json**: Symbol aliases. In addition to symbols determined at compile time, some symbols have aliases with offsets. These are defined in this file
* **.zip**: The source code package, containing the implementation source code of this kernel

As a kernel developer, you need to program specific source code, compile it into ROM and symbol table files, define necessary aliases, create a correct manifest, provide source code as needed, and finally package all files into a single ZIP file at its root directory.

## Installing

Click the corresponding home screen button and menu item to open the "Installed Kernels" dialog. Here you can install or uninstall kernels, navigate to links they define, or eject their source code, among other operations. It also shows how many currently loaded projects in the workspace reference a specific kernel.
