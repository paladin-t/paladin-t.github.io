Whether you have prior programming experience or have used any dialect of BASIC, you will find programming with GB BASIC to be straightforward and easy to learn.

Let's get started! By writing the simplest program to make GB BASIC say hello to the world.

```basic
10 print "Hello"
20 goto 10
```
<!-- prg
!edit, run, title="Run me!", style=""
url://prgs/hello-world-1.txt
-->

<div class="content-highlight" style="min-height: 48px;">
  <img src="imgs/logo-nokbd.png" class="logo-tip">
  <span class="content-text">
    You can click the "EDIT" and "RUN" buttons above the code snippets at any time to load and use the code in the in-page environment. It is recommended to try out these codes and making any modifications to see what happens.
  </span>
</div>

That's awesome! Now you have written your first program in GB BASIC.

In next episode, we will introduce the basic syntax and program structure of GB BASIC.
