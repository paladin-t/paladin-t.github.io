[col=0x6f95abff]Tips: Dietary Favor[/col]

The Legend of Pomodoro respects
various dietary preferences and
provides options to enable vegetarian
mode or disable fish-related trades.
Please note that these options only
affect how items are presented and do
not impact numerical progression in
the game. For example, enabling
vegetarian mode will replace some
meat-based foods with vegetarian
alternatives, and disabling fish will
replace fish-based foods with other
items. Purchase, upgrade, and
progression calculations remain
unaffected and are consistent for all
players, regardless of preference.
