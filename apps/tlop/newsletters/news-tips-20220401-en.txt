  * "Reset all data" button enabled
    in the settings page, do not
    click this unless you know what
    you are doing
* "-n WORK;REST" for custom notification sounds (.wav),
  i.e. `-n "X:/xxx/work.wav;X:/xxx/rest.wav"`

TLOP also loads and parses startup
options from file, create an
"args.txt" under TLOP's root
directory for it.
